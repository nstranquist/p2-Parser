# P2 - Parser 

This is a parser for the program translation project.

As discussed during office hours, I'll be including output of the program in the `output/` folder, since my local dev environment compiles but does not compile with `make` on Delmar without throwing errors.

Tests are included in the `tests/` folder, and their names correspond with the output names. `p2-[test-name]-output` is the format I used to name the output screenshots

### Steps to Run (skip if on Delmar)

1. Run `make` in the directory
2. Run `./parser [filename]` where filename is the file you want to test. It should be written according to he specified programming language BNF grammar

Thank you very much!
